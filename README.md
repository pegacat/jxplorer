# Commercial Version Update June 25 '18
========================================

Pricing and Security Tweak for https://jxworkbench.com - site is now https enabled, and individual licences are now $9.95.

JXWorkbench is a commercial bundle of JXplorer; the base code remains open source, but it also includes:
* An LDAP reporting engine
* Import/Export of CSV files (including MS Excel format CSV)
* RegExp Find and Replace for indexed and unindexed directories
* Find and Replace with attribute substitution 
* Perpetual licence
* Enterprise licencing and support options

... However JXPlorer is still available and open source, and is an excellent general purpose LDAP browser!
